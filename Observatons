Looking at the data output of Purchasing Analysis the total revenue based on the total number of unique items is very less. The average price per item, is calculated to be vey less.

Another observation that can be derived from looking at the data is that the male percentage is higher than any other gender, female is next and other/non-disclosed is close to nothing. But when we look at the age demographics the higher percentage of purchasers are between 20-24.

If we look the section's most profitable and most popular Items, the top most item is Oathbreaker, but the highest priced item is Nirvana which is 4th on the list. Even the items that are second and third on the list are less expensive. If the price for the most popular list was close enough to the price of Nirvana the profits would increase by 16% on that item.
